# BBC Microbit Accelerometer Alarm
## **A simple alarm for the BBC micro:bit written in Python**

**Designed to be attached to a door and used to detect if the door has been opened.**

## User Guide:
When in idle/menu mode you can change the LED matrix intensity by touching the micro:bit logo, there is a full power mode and low power mode to lower energy consumption.
To activate arm the system, press both buttons at the same time.
To deactivate the system at any point, touch the micro:bit logo

## Future changes/improvements
Make the system fully modular  
Improve the countdown loops

## Known annoyances
**YES I DIDN'T USE CASE STATEMENTS** - because they aren't supported in the online assembler, and I can't be bothered to look for an assembler that supports a newer version of Python at the moment
