# BBC Microbit Accelerometer Alarm
## **A simple alarm for the BBC micro:bit written in Python**

**Designed to be attached to a door and used to detect if the door has been opened.**

## User Guide:
When in idle/menu mode you can change the LED matrix intensity by touching the micro:bit logo, there is a full power mode and low power mode to lower energy consumption.
To arm the system, press both buttons at the same time.
To deactivate the system at any point, touch the micro:bit logo

## Future changes/improvements
~~Make the system fully modular~~ ✓ **DONE** in [v1.0.1](https://github.com/matthew-townson/BBC-Microbit-Accelerometer-Alarm/releases/tag/v1.0.1), expanded later in [v1.1.0](https://github.com/matthew-townson/BBC-Microbit-Accelerometer-Alarm/releases/tag/v1.1.0)  
~~Improve the countdown loops~~ ✓ **DONE** in [v1.1.0](https://github.com/matthew-townson/BBC-Microbit-Accelerometer-Alarm/releases/tag/v1.1.0)    
_**Since I've done the things I set out to do, I think this project can sit for now, unless anything massive comes up or I feel like adding bits to it, it is done.**_  
If you have any suggestions etc let me know!

## Known annoyances
**YES I DIDN'T USE CASE STATEMENTS** - because they aren't supported in the online assembler, and I can't be bothered to look for an assembler that supports a newer version of Python at the moment
